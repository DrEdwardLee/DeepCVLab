class ResNeXt_with_lidar_branch(ResNet):
    """ResNeXt backbone.
    Args:
        depth (int): Depth of resnet, from {18, 34, 50, 101, 152}.
        in_channels (int): Number of input image channels. Normally 3.
        num_stages (int): Resnet stages, normally 4.
        groups (int): Group of resnext.
        base_width (int): Base width of resnext.
        strides (Sequence[int]): Strides of the first block of each stage.
        dilations (Sequence[int]): Dilation of each stage.
        out_indices (Sequence[int]): Output from which stages.
        style (str): `pytorch` or `caffe`. If set to "pytorch", the stride-two
            layer is the 3x3 conv layer, otherwise the stride-two layer is
            the first 1x1 conv layer.
        frozen_stages (int): Stages to be frozen (all param fixed). -1 means
            not freezing any parameters.
        norm_cfg (dict): dictionary to construct and config norm layer.
        norm_eval (bool): Whether to set norm layers to eval mode, namely,
            freeze running stats (mean and var). Note: Effect on Batch Norm
            and its variants only.
        with_cp (bool): Use checkpoint or not. Using checkpoint will save some
            memory while slowing down the training speed.
        zero_init_residual (bool): whether to use zero init for last norm layer
            in resblocks to let them behave as identity.
